This software based on Node.js (0.10.x) let you control your Desktop (prefer linux) directly
from your Dualshock 3.
 

 * Left stick : move mouse
 * Right stick : scroll (only down or up)
 * x : one left mouse click
 * square : Toggle left mouse click
 * circle : one right mouse click
 * r1 : press enter on keyboard
 * r2 : activate or dismiss virtual keyboard (work natively on ubuntu based distribution,
else you have to install onboard (linux))
 * up, down, left, right : press corresponding arrow on keybaord


You need Node.js 0.10.x to use this software. Will not work on new Node.js version.
This software still really simple and can be improved by many ways, even turned in
true graphical software.
